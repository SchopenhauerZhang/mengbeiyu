An ordinary Chinese poverty alleviation clerk has been working in poverty alleviation for four years at the grassroots level. He is currently engaged in [petition work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petitioning_(China)) （State Bureau of Letters and Calls manage a petitioning system which Chinese people can lodge petitions）and has recorded everything he has experienced in poverty alleviation at the grassroots level with hundreds of thousands of words. The bitter life and the events that he experienced at work are an epic masterpiece of contemporary Chinese society. For us to uncover the truth about poverty alleviation, why is poverty alleviation difficult? Why do the petitioners have no fear, what the Chinese government has done, and what needs to be done. The most touching  is the sadness and suffering of an ordinary Chinese poverty alleviation clerk .
